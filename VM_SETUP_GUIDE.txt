VM SETUP - COMPLETE GUIDE
=========================

This guide will help you set up Consumable Tracker on a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 VM.

PREREQUISITES:
- Ubuntu 22.04 Server VM (2GB RAM, 20GB disk minimum)
- SSH access to the VM
- Files ready in D:/consumable-tracker on Windows

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:

1. CREATE AND ACCESS YOUR VM
   - Create Ubuntu 22.04 VM in Proxmox
   - SSH into the VM as a regular user (not root)

2. DOWNLOAD THE SETUP SCRIPT
   On your VM, run ONE of these options:

   Option A - If you can upload files first:
   - Upload quick-vm-install.sh to your VM
   - Run: bash quick-vm-install.sh

   Option B - Direct download (if hosted):
   - Run: curl -sSL https://yourserver/quick-vm-install.sh | bash

   Option C - Copy and paste:
   - Copy the contents of quick-vm-install.sh
   - Run: nano install.sh
   - Paste the contents
   - Save and exit (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter)
   - Run: bash install.sh

3. FOLLOW THE SCRIPT PROMPTS
   The script will:
   - Install Docker, Docker Compose, and Node.js
   - Configure firewall
   - Create /opt/consumable-tracker directory
   - Prepare for file upload

4. AFTER DOCKER INSTALLATION
   If Docker was just installed, you MUST:
   - Exit SSH: exit
   - SSH back into the VM
   - Continue to step 5

5. UPLOAD APPLICATION FILES
   Using WinSCP or similar:
   - Connect to your VM
   - Navigate to /opt/consumable-tracker
   - Upload ALL files from D:/consumable-tracker
   - Include all subdirectories (backend/, frontend/, etc.)

6. COMPLETE THE INSTALLATION
   On the VM:
   - cd /opt/consumable-tracker
   - chmod +x *.sh
   - ./pre-install.sh
   - ./install.sh

7. VERIFY INSTALLATION
   - Run: ./health-check.sh
   - All services should show as healthy

8. ACCESS THE APPLICATION
   - Find your VM IP: hostname -I
   - Open browser: http://YOUR_VM_IP:3000
   - API endpoint: http://YOUR_VM_IP:5000/api

TROUBLESHOOTING:

If "Failed to load data":
- Check: docker ps (all 3 containers should be running)
- Check logs: docker-compose logs backend
- Test API: curl http://localhost:5000/health

If npm errors during install:
- Run: ./fix-npm-build.sh
- Or try: ./complete-fix.sh

If nothing works:
- Run: ./cleanup.sh
- Start over from step 6

ENABLING AUTO-START:
To start the app automatically when VM boots:

1. Create systemd service:
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/consumable-tracker.service

2. Add this content:
   [Unit]
   Description=Consumable Tracker
   After=docker.service
   Requires=docker.service

   [Service]
   Type=oneshot
   RemainAfterExit=yes
   WorkingDirectory=/opt/consumable-tracker
   ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose up -d
   ExecStop=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose down
   User=YOUR_USERNAME

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target

3. Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual username

4. Enable service:
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable consumable-tracker
   sudo systemctl start consumable-tracker

USEFUL COMMANDS:
- View logs: docker-compose logs -f
- Stop app: docker-compose down
- Start app: docker-compose up -d
- Restart app: docker-compose restart
- Backup data: ./backup.sh
- Update app: ./update.sh

NEXT STEPS:
1. Create your first consumable category
2. Add some items to track
3. Set up recurring tasks
4. Configure alerts (future feature)

TIPS:
- The app automatically decreases consumable amounts daily
- Tasks can recur daily, weekly, or monthly
- All data is stored in MongoDB (Docker volume)
- Backups are stored in ./backups/

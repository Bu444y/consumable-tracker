   - Added test-api.sh to verify system functionality

CORRECT INSTALLATION PROCESS:

1. Clean up any previous attempts:
   ./cleanup.sh

2. Generate package-lock.json files:
   ./pre-install.sh

3. Run the main installation:
   ./install.sh

4. If any issues occur:
   ./quick-fix.sh

5. Verify the API is working:
   ./test-api.sh

6. Access the application:
   http://localhost:3000

KEY CHANGES TO DEPLOYMENT:
- Frontend now uses nginx proxy to reach backend
- API calls go through /api path (proxied to backend:5000)
- No need for REACT_APP_API_URL in production
- CORS is configured to accept all localhost origins

The app should now:
✓ Load without errors
✓ Show default categories (Kitchen, Bathroom, etc.)
✓ Allow adding new items and categories
✓ Have working navigation including settings back button
✓ Properly save and retrieve data

Total files: 40
All scripts are executable after: chmod +x *.sh
